 * stacklessio.h
 * StacklessIO is a system for managing asynchronous requests for python
 * programs.  This involves generating "event" objects that are executed.
 * The requests then may "submit" themselves to a "event queue".  The requests
 * are then "dispatched" by the main python thread before being discarded.
 * The main application for this is in Stackless Python to perform blocking
 * operations by blocking "tasklets".  For example, a request to read from
 * disk may involve the following actions:
 * 1) The python main thread creates a ReadRequest (a subclass of IOEvent)
 *    object and kicks off its execution.  This may for example start a worker
 *    thread running.
 * 2) The tasklet in question blocks, e.g. by calling "receive" on a channel
 *    that is part of the request.
 * 3) the request finishes running and submits itself to the event queue.
 * 4) The event queue dispatches this request, which involves waking up the
 *    sleeping tasklet
 * Events may perform their execution any way they like.  In particular,
 * they may make use of worker threads that don't occupy the python GIL.
 * Submitting requests to the dispatcher is thread-safe and doesn't require
 * holding the GIL.
 *
 * The main idea behind this is to provide a central place for dipatching
 * asynchronous requests like this, the Event Queue.  This allows one to
 * devise a single scheduling policy for an application and ensure some
 * sense of fairness amoung multiple requests coming from multiple modules.
 * In the absence of this, various modules may design their own solutions
 * that can interact badly with one and other.
 *
 * StacklessIO is object oriented.  Events are required to inherit from
 * a virtual base class and implement a certain interface.  Specializations
 * are provided so that an application may need to implement only a single
 * virtual function.  This makes it very easy to implement such requests
 * from C++ Python code.  The classes are exported from the python DLL
 * for easy c++ linkage.
 *
 * Dispatching can be done in various ways.  In single threaded python it
 * can be done at convenient places, such as prior to going to sleep.  But
 * mainly it is supposed to be done at regular intervals, such as at the
 * start of the application loop.
 *
 * A facility for waking up the application is provided so that the
 * application can sleep until an event is ready.  Whenever the dispatcher
 * is in a state that is ready to dispatch, an Event object is signaled
 * which the main application can use to be woken up.
 *
 * C++ exceptions are used throughout.  Python exceptions that occur
 * from the Python API are converted to corresponding C++ exceptions
 * from the PyCcp.h header, such as PyError.  Win32 errors are also
 * raised as exceptions.  This simplifies all control flow.  Clients
 * of StacklessIO must be careful to catch all exceptions and convert
 * them back to Python exceptions as appropriate.  Utility functions to
 * do this exist in PyCcp.h, but it requires RTTI to be enabled.
 *
 * This is the core of StacklessIO: Events and the Event Queue.
 * This is then used by other files as a building block to provide
 * stackless-blocking socket operations using Windows IO Completion and
 * stackless-blocking file operations.  It is a design principle of
 * StacklessIO that its basic scheduling model is decoupled in an
 * object-oriented way from the particulars of each IO application.
